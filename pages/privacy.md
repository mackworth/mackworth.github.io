## Ultimate Stopwatch Privacy Policy
{: .jumbotron}

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decides to use my software.

PineTree Software built the Ultimate Stopwatch app (aka Watches) as a Commercial application. This App is provided by PineTree Software and is intended for use as-is with no warranty.

If you choose to use Watches, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used only for providing and improving the app. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

#### Information Collection and Use

For a better experience, while using our App, you may provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to Runners' Name, Email, and Photos. The information that the App requests is retained solely on your device and your backups and is not collected by me in any way.

The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. The privacy policy of the third-party service providers used by the app may be found here: [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy) and [FreshDesk](https://www.freshdesk.com/privacy/). Firebase lets us know of any technical problems in using the App, and FreshDesk provides the technical support platform we use to help you with your use of the App.

#### Log Data

I want to inform you that when you use my App, Apple and Firebase will collect data and information on your device called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my App, the time and date of your use of the App, and other statistics. No personally identifying information is provided to me through this process. FreshDesk may also collect such information when you ask for technical support.

#### Cookies {#cooks}

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

This App does not use any cookies explicitly. However, the third-party services may use cookies to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse these cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of their Services.

#### Children’s Privacy

These App do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13, nor is any personally identifying information provided to our server. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.

#### Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
