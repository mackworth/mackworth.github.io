## Ultimate Stopwatch

{: .lead}
Welcome to Ultimate Stopwatch version 2.8.

##### Watches 2.8 is a major update internally, but with relatively few visible changes.
##### It takes advantage of many new iOS features: more compatible and better performing.
##### Simple to use, but powerful enough to handle your most complex needs.

#### Some things to try:
* Staggered Start to spread out Runners with a full-screen Launch Board
* Huge Start button to make starting easier
* Batch launch a group during a Race
* Interval races (Run, pause, run again ...)
* Up Volume to start a Race without even looking
* Volume during Race to create an unassigned Lap (or Stop)
</div>
<div class="span6" markdown="1">
#### New features in 2.8.0:

* Increased spacing between watches
* Scale/crop circular photos with higher resolution
* Faces with larger photos to identify runners
* Edit a race's Date and Location
* Works on Macs as well
* Restructured Preferences with help text
</div>
</div>
##### We hope 2.8 works well for you.  If it does, there's nothing that'll say it better than a good review on iTunes (see Watches' menu). If not, let us know how we can help at our support site (also in Watches menu!).
