#### No Limits:
* Time an unlimited number of watches (with an incredible 180 displayed at once on an iPad Pro!)
* Track unlimited laps per watch (last 4 to 10 displayed, depending on watch "face" used)
* Track unlimited number of races, each named with location and any notes
* Have your Watches run all the time (independently of whether app is running or not); no power used when watches are not displayed on screen

#### Complete control
* Edit built-in activity list to include whatever sports/events you track
* Control each watch separately, or use master start/stop/reset
* Choose from 25 different stopwatch formats (iPhone/iPad, bigger/smaller, more/less info shown)
* Switch at any time between split/cumulative display, or even both!
* Control the fractions of a second to display (tenths, hundreds, thousandths)
 
#### Unlimited People
* Organize your people into teams, classes, or groups
* Report for each person on what their races/times have been across all races
* Import people from your contacts, including photos and emails
* Track personal best for each kind of race for each person

#### Flexible Reports
* Add notes to each race or even each person in a race
* Sort reports by time or by name
* Print reports or copy/paste into other applications, or export as CSV
* Send reports via email to each person or to the whole group
* Track and report which type of activity was timed (even separately for each watch)
* Find a race by name, or use the map to find it by location
* Set time display units and split options for reports separately from watches

#### Easy to use
* Launch a race without even looking, using the volume button
* Not sure who's coming in? Save a temporary Lap or Stop and assign it later
* Load a race for a whole group in a single tap with a huge start button
* Auto-sort watches: as each person completes a lap, they drop to the bottom, so next lap they're easy to find.
* Or manually drag watches into whatever order you like
* Track photos for each person to help identify during a large group run
* Add, sort, or delete watches, even while race is ongoing
* Correct timing mistakes by easily editing any time for any watch or lap
* Undo any mistakes throughout the app (such as on a false start or hitting the wrong lap button: just shake and accept the undo)
* Use Staggered starts to automatically spread out your runners over time, or launch a new group all at once
* Full Screen launch board so each runner knows when to go
